</details>

[BEDTools](https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is a powerful suite of command-line utilities designed for genomic analysis, enabling users to manipulate and analyze genomic interval data efficiently. One of its key applications is `coverage` analysis, which determines the depth of sequencing reads aligned to specific genomic regions. This allows for the quantification of how well genomic features are covered by sequencing data.

In the pipeline, we are summarizing positions where 90% of the read is in the amplicon.

#### Positional N Depth

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `reporting/positional_n/`
  - `<SAMPLE>.per_base_n.tsv`: Summary of how many Ns were seen at each reference position

#### Generate Final Report

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `MeaSeq_Report.html`: Final report with all metrics and visualizations

</details>

The MeaSeq Report HTML file is the final summary of all the samples run by the pipeline generated using RMarkdown. Most of the generated results in the pipeline are included in this report. The report displays sample specifc variant metrics and data visualizations.

If running with a large number of samples, the report may take a second to open up on your web-browser (>100 samples usually)

A sample report generated from publicly available samples can be [found here](images/MeaSeq_Report.html).
